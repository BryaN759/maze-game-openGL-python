 maze-game-openGL-python
 Here we have used openGL for creating a maze game, which has used points/dots to line algorithm to generate the maze and a points/dots to circle algorithm to generate the ball.
 We have also used Desmos to create essential coordiantes to create our Graph for plotting the points/dots
 Also, added a better maze with the same process.
